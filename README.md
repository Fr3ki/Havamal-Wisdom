# Havamal-Wisdom
A fun little project for all my fellow heathens / norse pagans. This script picks a random line from the Havamal and prints it in your terminal.


So far I have only added 15 lines. Any contributions are greatly aprreciated. For this perticular program to work the stanza must be in one singular line in the text file.

Skall Heathens.

DISCLAIMER:
Many affiliate Heathenism or Norse Paganism with Nazi Germany. I never have, and never will support any ideas that promote hatred or discrimination toward any good hearted individual. For more information on see: https://www.heathensagainst.org/
