#Havamal Wisdom

The Havamal is an ancient old norse text, which is said to contain advice on living from the cheif god, and god of wisdom Odin.

#Functionality

This tool will pick a random stanza from the included havamal file, and present it to your terminal, just incase you needed a piece of wisdom!

Also included in this repo is a tool to pick a random rune from the Elder Futhark, the alphabet used by the people of ancient Scandinavia. Each rune has a meaning, and this script can function as a sort of magic 8 ball but for Vikings!
