#Havamal Wisdom

The Havamal is an ancient old norse text, which is said to contain advice on living from the cheif god, and god of wisdom Odin.

#Functionality

This tool will pick a random stanza from the included havamal file, and present it to your terminal, just incase you needed a piece of wisdom!

Also included in this repo is a tool to pick a random rune from the Elder Futhark, the alphabet used by the people of ancient Scandinavia. Each rune has a meaning, and this script can function as a sort of magic 8 ball but for Vikings!

#Dependancies

The Cowsay package is not installed by default, however it is not completly needed for this script to be run, if you do not want to install cowsay, replacee the "cowsay.cow" on line 7 with print and remove the cowsay import statement. Easy as that!
